# Typescript Game Engine
A game engine for the web made in Typescript.

## How to build
Install nodejs, then run 'npx webpack' in the project folder. This will transpile and bundle the Typescript files to a single bundle.js file and put it in the dist folder.

## Current goals
Here's a shortlist of things that I would like to implement in this game engine. 
- Viewports
- A level editor
- Live multiplayer (Websockets)
- 3D (WebGL)

## Notice
This game engine was made mostly to practice Typescript. It's far from done and I do not know if I'll ever finish it.
